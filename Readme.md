## CIFAR-10 Classification 

in this project we will build a CNN model on CIFAR-10 data set and train it on it.

In the first file, we used transfer learning, and in the second file, we used our own model by applying different optimizers and methods to reduce the risk of gradient explosion.

#### Requirements
- keras==2.12.0
- tensorflow==2.15.0


#### Notebooks
- `CIFAR10_TransferLearning.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of the project using transfer learning.
  
- `CIFAR10_Classification`.ipynb: Contains the implementation of the project using a custom model with different optimizers and methods.
